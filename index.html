      <h3>My experience at KIT</h3> 
      <p>Things were really rough at the beginning.<br>When I started enrolling,I was lost in many areas, but the program taught me how to find my wayout and to be strong.<br>
     The program has helped me to discipline myself to study and understand large notes and to figure out problems by myself.<br>
     I have a stutter and I don't know how to address group of people, I'm scared most times, but the program has helped me to face the fear of not talking<br>
     and gradually I am getting better everyday.</p>
